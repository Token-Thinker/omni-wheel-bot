# Simplified Jacobian Omnidirectional Robot Software

An open-source project creates a software base for the Omnidirectional-AMR firmware.

---
## Background
Leveraging [simulated reverse kinematic](https://github.com/Token-Thinker/OnmiBot_Animiation) 
to create a fun and interactive toy for my friends and family.
---

## Features

- [x] **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Data**
- [ ] **Pulse Width Modulation Module**
- [ ] **Directional Feedback**
- [ ] **Omni-Control** The robot's angular velocity (omega) can be customized through user input.
